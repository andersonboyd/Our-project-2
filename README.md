### Our proposal

Our group is making a cryptocurrency trading platform using Coinbase API / NPM package for real-time market information in conjunction with a Sequelized MySQL database that stores user information as well as information regarding their coins. On user signup/login authentication users will be able to view an overview of the crypto market as well as specifics for each currency type and a specific user page displaying user and coin information. MVP is to show market overview on user login.
